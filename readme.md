1) atmosphere.cpp : C++ and Root defined functions to calculate the matter traversed through when traveling through the atmosphere. Used to determine atmospheric interaction depth for a cosmic ray event.

2) fd_pedestal_animation_good_qual.py : Generate animations of the pedestal values of our arrangment of Photomultiplier Tubes (PMTS) for our Cosmic Ray Detector Sites to make animations of the night sky in the field of view to help determine if stars are visible or the weather is cloudy.
